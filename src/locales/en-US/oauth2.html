<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="oauth2">
  The `oauth2` Node-RED node enables `OAuth2 authentication` and provides an `access token` for authenticated API requests.

  ### Inputs

  : container (string) : This refers to the name of the container that is intended to receive the message object. By default, it is set to oauth2Response.
  : grant type (object) : This specifies the grant type used to obtain the access token.
  : access token url (string) : This is the URL used to obtain the access token.
  : client id (string) : This is the unique identifier for the client application.
  : client secret (string) : This is the secret key used to authenticate the client application.

  - grant: `password`
    : username (string) : This is the username used for authentication.
    : password (string) : This is the password used for authentication.

  - grant type: `authorization code`
    : authorization endpoint (string) : This is the URL of the authorization endpoint.
    : code (string) : This is the authorization code. _read only_

  : scope (string) : This specifies the scope of the access request.

  : use proxy (boolean) : This specifies whether to use a proxy or not.

  - use proxy: `true`
    : Proxy Configuration (object) : This specifies the configuration for the proxy.

  : only send non-2xx responses to catch node (boolean) : This specifies whether to only catch non-2xx responses.
  : embedded credentials (boolean) : This specifies whether to include the client credentials in the token request body for authentication purposes.
  : reject Unauthorized (boolean) : This specifies whether to reject unauthorized requests. The rejectUnauthorized parameter controls SSL/TLS certificate validation for the server, with true enforcing validation and false disabling it.

  **`Note:`**

  > - If running behind a proxy, the standard `http_proxy=...` environment variable should be set and `Node-RED restarted, or use Proxy Configuration`. If Proxy Configuration was set, the configuration take precedence over environment variable.

  > - The OAuth redirect URL is set by default to `/oauth2/redirect`, which is the endpoint responsible for receiving the authorization `code`.

  ### Outputs

  : access_token (string) : This is the access token obtained from the OAuth2 server.
  : expires_in (number) : This is the duration of time, in seconds, until the access token expires.
  : token_type (string) : This is the type of the token. For example, "Bearer".
  : scope (string) : This specifies the scope of the access granted by the token obtained.
  : refresh_token (string) : This is the refresh token that can be used to obtain a new access token before the current one expires.

  ### Details

  The `msg.oauth2Request` object contains the OAuth2 request details that are set by the node. The following are the different types of credentials that can be used for authentication:

  # `Client Credentials`

  The client credentials can be sent as part of the message payload to the node. The `msg.oauth2Request.credentials` object should contain the following properties:

  - `grant_type` (string): This specifies the grant type. For dynamic credentials, the value should be set to "client_credentials".
  - `client_id` (string): This is the client ID of the OAuth2 client.
  - `client_secret` (string): This is the client secret of the OAuth2 client.
  - `scope` (string): This specifies the scope of the access requested.

  Here's an example:

  ```js
  msg.oauth2Request = {
    access_token_url: "http://localhost:8080/v1/oauth/tokens",
    credentials: {
      grant_type: "client_credentials",
      client_id: "test_client_1",
      client_secret: "test_secret",
      scope: "read_write",
    },
  };
  return msg;
  ```

  # `Password`

  The username and password can be sent as part of the message payload to the node. The `msg.oauth2Request.credentials` object should contain the following properties:

  - `grant_type` (string): This specifies the grant type. For password credentials, the value should be set to "password".
  - `client_id` (string): This is the client ID of the OAuth2 client.
  - `client_secret` (string): This is the client secret of the OAuth2 client.
  - `scope` (string): This specifies the scope of the access requested.
  - `username` (string): This is the username of the user.
  - `password` (string): This is the password of the user.

  Here's an example:

  ```js
  msg.oauth2Request = {
    access_token_url: "http://localhost:8080/v1/oauth/tokens",
    credentials: {
      grant_type: "password",
      client_id: "test_client_1",
      client_secret: "test_secret",
      scope: "read_write",
      username: "test@user",
      password: "test_password",
    },
  };
  return msg;
  ```

  # `refreshToken`

  A refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. The `msg.oauth2Request.credentials` object should contain the following properties:

  - `grant_type` (string): This specifies the grant type. For refresh token credentials, the value should be set to "refresh_token".
  - `client_id` (string): This is the client ID of the OAuth2 client.
  - `client_secret` (string): This is the client secret of the OAuth2 client.
  - `scope` (string): This specifies the scope of the access requested.
  - `refresh_token` (string): This is the refresh token obtained from a previous authentication.

  Here's an example:

  ```js
  let refreshToken = global.get("refreshToken");

  msg.oauth2Request = {
    access_token_url: "http://localhost:8080/v1/oauth/tokens",
    credentials: {
      grant_type: "refresh_token",
      client_id: "test_client_1",
      client_secret: "test_secret",
      scope: "read_write",
      refresh_token: refreshToken,
    },
  };
  return msg;
  ```
